# Makoshika

Design:

Have you ever wanted to make smart, informed, and profitable stock trades all on your own? Makoshika is an automated analysis software
that will allow you to review huge amounts of data scraped from the web, all contained in convenient and easily visualized knowledge graphs
that are generated with the help of AI. Just enter in which companies you are interested in trading, and Makoshika will pull in any relevant
data about that company, be it financial statements, news articles, or anything else that would indicate whether a buy would be a good decision
or not. The knowledge graphs that are computed will find connections between even the most obscure points of data.

Simon HTML

I learned how to put basic HTML structures together to create a website that can go between pages. I also learned how to make basic graphics using html and the svg type. Although none of this is styled or functional, I still know how to throw together a basic and correct layout of different html elements.
