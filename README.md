# Makoshika

Design:

Have you ever wanted to make smart, informed, and profitable stock trades all on your own? Makoshika is an automated analysis software
that will allow you to review huge amounts of data scraped from the web, all contained in convenient and easily visualized knowledge graphs
that are generated with the help of AI. Just enter in which companies you are interested in trading, and Makoshika will pull in any relevant
data about that company, be it financial statements, news articles, or anything else that would indicate whether a buy would be a good decision
or not. The knowledge graphs that are computed will find connections between even the most obscure points of data.

Simon HTML

I learned how to put basic HTML structures together to create a website that can go between pages. I also learned how to make basic graphics using html and the svg type. Although none of this is styled or functional, I still know how to throw together a basic and correct layout of different html elements.


Simon CSS

I learned how to integrate bootstrap and regular CSS into an actual webpage. This one was more complicated, and already had the basic html layout, but I saw how to combine this into an actual application and make it look more professional. I also found the method to add responsivity to the application based on size to be very interesting.


Startup HTML and CSS

I learned how to combine the concepts of this class into an actual project. I found it very helpful to have the specification made beforehand. The most interesting thing that I found was editing the DOM through javascript, which is not technically supposed to be a part of this project, but oh well. If pure javascript and HTML can offer this much reactivity, I am excited to see what an actual framework can do.

Startup Javascript

I learned how to interact with the DOM effectively using javascript and how to update information that needs to be displayed. I also learned the basics of interactivity using Javascript and making it so that the website is responsive and can wait for certain amounts of time so that everything is not put in at once.
I also learned how to interact with an HTML canvas with Javascript and change it in real time.

Simon service

I learned about how to fetch data from remote sources in a basic web app. I specifically learned how to store and fetch different points of data to and from a web application. This was especially useful because it allows for functionality to store and then fetch scores without them being lost on reload.

Simon DB

Although I already knew the basics of databases, it helped to learn about storing sensitive information in environment variables. In my startup, this is probably something I should change by storing API keys in the environment variables instead of in the code itself. That way it is not visible publicly.
